I create an application to help a family member determine if the amount of money they are paying is sufficient to purchase a house. 

The family member will use the application to input their gross monthly income (before deductions), estimated monthly tax deducted, and estimated monthly expenditures in various categories. 

Then they can choose between renting accommodation or buying a property. If they choose to rent, they can input the monthly rental amount. If they choose to buy a property, they must enter the purchase price, total deposit, interest rate, and number of months to repay. 

The Application will calculate the monthly home loan repayment for buying a property and alert the user if the repayment amount is more than a third of their gross monthly income, indicating that approval of the home loan is unlikely. The Application will also calculate the available monthly money after all specified deductions.
